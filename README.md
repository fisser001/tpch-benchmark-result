# tpch-benchmark-result
This repository contains the visualizations of the conducted benchmark.

The results are distributed accross the following 3 directories:

## single-user workloads
Contains all visualizations regarding the single-user workloads. The directory is further subdivided in two directories. The directory "exeution times" contains all visualizations regarding execution time, which are the boxplot diagram, bar char diagrams and the colored table with all average execution times over all schema, scale factors, tools and queries. 
The "utilization" diagram contains all visualization regarding the CPU and RAM workloads during the query execution.

## multi-user workloads
Contains all visualizations regarding the multi-user workloads. The directory is further subdivided in two directories. The directory "exeution times" contains all visualizations regarding execution time, which are the boxplot diagram, bar char diagrams and the colored table with all average execution times over all schema, scale factors, tools and queries. 
The "utilization" diagram contains all visualization regarding the CPU and RAM workloads during the query execution.

## single vs multi-user workloads
This directory contains the calculations of the deviations between single-user and multi-user execution times.
